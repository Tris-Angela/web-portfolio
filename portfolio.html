        <h3>About me probably "BEAUTY"</h3>
        <p>I like people who have a sense of individuality. I love expression and anything awkward and imperfect, because that's natural and that's real. Show yourself, do not pretend otherwise. I think it's beautiful the way you sparkle when you talk about the things you love. And I like it when you disseminate. when you open up and dare to be completely honest. and when you laugh at the smallest things and then look into my eyes. When you are yourself, and show me who you are.</p>
