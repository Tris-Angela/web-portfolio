            <h2>"being"</h2>
            <h3>Don't Wait for Opportunity, Create it.</h3>
            <p>
                Today I trust that just "being" is enough. Rather than making myself crazy and tired by trying to figure out the answers, or see the picture, or work out how it will all work out. I choose, instead, to focus my energy on staying present enjoying each moment as it presents itself. I open my eyes to life, as it is, right now. I know the gift of clarity will come when the time is right.<br> I like people who have a sense of individuality. I love expression and anything awkward and imperfect, because that's natural and that's real. Show yourself, do not pretend otherwise. I think it's beautiful the way you sparkle when you talk about the things you love. And I like it when you disseminate. when you open up and dare to be completely honest. and when you laugh at the smallest things and then look into my eyes. When you are yourself, and show me who you are.

But remember, what makes it hard is also what makes it valuable.</p>
